Task 06 – AI Deep Fake / Street Interview
📘 Objective

The objective of this research task was to convert insights from my previous LLM analysis (Task 05) into an AI-generated interview format. The goal was to simulate a “street interview” style conversation that summarizes data-driven insights in a conversational and engaging way.

🎤 What I Created

I wrote a scripted AI interview using insights from the 2024 Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse dataset. The script focused on performance highlights, late-game struggles, and strategic recommendations. I then converted the script into a realistic voiceover using ElevenLabs, which provided natural-sounding AI-generated audio.

🛠️ Tools Used

ChatGPT – To write and refine the interview script

ElevenLabs – To synthesize AI voiceover audio

Word (.docx) – For formatting the final script

(Explored but not used) D-ID / Canva – For potential video enhancement

📄 Files Included

Task 6 Deep Fake AI.docx – The final interview script

Rachel_mZvcfuHEpaNrQhRlns1r.mp3 – The AI-generated voiceover file

README.md / README.docx – This summary of tools, process, and outcome

✅ Reflections & Challenges

Using ElevenLabs was smooth and intuitive, allowing me to generate clean audio quickly. I iterated on the script to make the tone more conversational and natural, especially for transitions between questions. The biggest challenge was making the AI voice feel like a real person and maintaining pacing that matches a human conversation. I learned how AI-generated content can turn raw stats into something digestible and engaging.
