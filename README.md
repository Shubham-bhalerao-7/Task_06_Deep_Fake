# 🎙️ Task 06 – AI Deep Fake / Street Interview

## 📘 Objective
This task expands on the previous LLM analysis (Task 05) by transforming data insights into an AI-generated “street interview.” The focus is less on the final product and more on the process of generating a conversational audio summary using publicly available tools.

## 🎤 What I Created
Using insights from the 2024 Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse season, I wrote a scripted interview between an AI analyst and a virtual interviewer. The script highlights the team’s strengths, weaknesses, and strategic recommendations. I used ElevenLabs to turn the written script into a realistic AI voiceover.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: For scriptwriting and summarizing Task 05 insights
- **ElevenLabs**: For AI voice generation (used free trial credits)
- **Google Docs / Word**: For drafting and organizing script
- *(Optional tools explored)*: D-ID and Canva for potential video enhancements

## 📄 Files Included
- `Task 6 Deep Fake AI.docx`: Final interview script
- `audio_output.mp3`: AI-generated voiceover (produced using ElevenLabs)
- `README.md`: This project summary and documentation

## ✅ Reflections
This task helped me understand how to convert structured data into a narrative experience using AI. ElevenLabs was easy to use and created high-quality voice output. The most challenging part was pacing the script and keeping the tone natural. This method could be powerful for public-facing data storytelling.
